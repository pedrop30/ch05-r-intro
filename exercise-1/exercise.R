# Exercise-1: practice with basic syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born
hometown <- "Sao Paulo"
# Assign your name to the variable `my.name`
my.name <- "Pedro"
# Assign your height to a variable `my.height`
my.height <- "5'11''"
# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have
puppies <- 1
# Create a variable `puppy.price`, which is how expensive you think a puppy is
puppy.price <- 100
# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies
total.cost <- puppies*puppy.price
# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to true if the cost is greater than $1,000
too.expensive <- total.cost > 1000
# Create a variable `max_puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can afford for $1K.  Compute this
max_puppies <- 1000/puppy.price
# value in R, not just assign!

cat(hometown, my.name, my.height, puppies, puppy.price, total.cost,
    too.expensive, max_puppies)
